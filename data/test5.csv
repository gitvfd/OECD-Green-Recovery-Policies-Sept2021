The green agreement gives us a way to reach this goal. It is a framework that covers almost all policy areas, with a strong emphasis on social and economic issues in addition to environmental issues."" According to the Minister of the Environment Rene Koka, the green agreement will bring several opportunities for Estonia. “It is in our interest to move with innovation and find new perspectives for increasing the competitiveness of Estonian companies, increasing the volume of investments and opportunities for the transition to renewable energy. One important area for Estonia is the development of hydrogen and other renewable energy and fuel-based technologies. In my opinion, hydrogen is definitely one of the solutions of the future, and I believe that in ten years' time, hydrogen solutions could work very successfully both in Estonia and in Europe, ""said Kokk. Estonia supports the establishment of a long-term climate neutrality framework across the European Union in 2050 in European climate law. At the same time, increasing the European Union's 2030 climate target must be preceded by a thorough analysis of Member States and sectors. According to Estonia, the energy and transport sectors need the most investments, as it is important to ensure energy security and security of supply in the transition to climate neutrality. Estonia sees great potential, for example, in offshore wind farms, which is a good opportunity for greater use of renewable energy in the Nordic-Baltic region. There is also a need to support the development of innovative solutions, the development of green technologies and basic and applied research. The focus should also be on the implementation and use of future technologies and the development of the necessary skills. Estonia also emphasizes the importance of environmental education and the fact-based treatment of green issues. Estonia's position also points out that the initial European Green Agreement action plan published in December would also take into account the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. However, exit activities must be in line with the EU's long-term climate goals and the principles of the circular economy. At the moment, the EU and International Co-operation Department of Ministry of Environment of Estonia cannot point to a more detailed action plan. There is coherence at EU level and these effects are likely to be taken into account in future legislative proposals. But no changes to the current legislation are currently known on this subject.",https://www.valitsus.ee/et/uudised/valitsus-kinnitas-eesti-seisukohad-euroopa-rohelise-kokkuleppe-kohta     ,,Positive,,,

• On 14 July 2020, Korea’s President Moon Jae-in revealed a plan to commit KRW 160 trillion (USD 133 billion) to a “K-New Deal”.  The Korean New Deal will involve a direct investment of KRW 114 trillion from the national treasury by 2025, which with funding from the private sector and local governments will rise to around KRW 160 trillion. Korea commits KRW 42.7 trillion to Green New Deal by 2025. According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the Green New Deal would create 659,000 jobs. In July 2021, the treasury budget of K-new Deal was increased, whereat spending for the Green New Deal increased from 42.7 to 61 trillion Won; further measures were additionally added.

Component 2: Green Transition of Infrastructures - Investment of 16 trillion won from the treasury
Component 3:  Low-carbon and decentralized energy supply - Investment of 30 trillion won from the treasury
Component 4:  Innovation in the Green Industry - investment of 10.2 trillion won from the treasury

• The Green New Deal aims to transform the economy from carbon-dependent to a low-carbon one and prepare for the post-COVID-19 era and is supposed to foster the renewable energy sector. South Korea seeks to increase solar and wind capacity to 42.7 gigawatts by 2025, compared with 12.7 gigawatts in 2019. The plan also promises refurbishment of public rental housing and schools to make them zero-energy, and transformation of urban areas into smart green cities.

1. Establishment of the Presidential Climate Change Coordinating Commission (PCCCC) to coordinate the Just Transition. One of its first tasks will be to focus on understanding the impact of climate change on jobs, both positive and negative, and climate change responses by sector and location. This will require the urgent finalisation of the National Employment Vulnerability Assessment (NEVA) and thereafter, Sector Job Resilient Plans (SJRPs). The Commission will also explore opportunities for new upstream and downstream green jobs and green industries that should be exploited, and climate resilience interventions that need to be expanded.
2. South Africa’s Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS), also approved by Cabinet, will be deposited with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat.  This is further to the country’s NDC deposited with the UNFCCC ahead of the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in which countries committed to limited the increase in global average temperatures to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
